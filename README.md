# SocialMedia Word Counter

The SMWC App helps people type the accurate number of words accepted by various social media handles

 

### Usage

1. The App is to count how many words the user has typed based on the Social Media handle they have selected. And when they reach the limit
  of the SM handle they receive a message You have reached your maximum word count.
 
2. When a user selects a SocialMedia Handle, Words in the html page changes from 0 to the desired number of words. E.g if twitter is selected, word changes form 0 280.centered
  
3. When a user begins to type in the textarea, Word Count increases while word decreases.
  
4. Once word decreases to 0. The user is unable to type any further characters and gets the congratulatory message.
